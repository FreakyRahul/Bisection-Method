# Bisection-Method

## Bisection Method Root Finder

This repository contains Python code implementing the Bisection Method for finding roots of mathematical functions. The Bisection Method is an iterative numerical technique used to find the root of a real-valued function.

## Functionality

The provided Python script performs the following tasks:

Determines initial positive and negative values for the function by iterating through a range of numbers.
Implements the Bisection Method to find the root of the function.
Prints the approximation at each iteration along with the corresponding function value.

## To use the Bisection Method Root Finder:

## Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Bisection-Method-Root-Finder.git

## Navigate to the cloned directory:

cd Bisection-Method-Root-Finder

## Run the Python script:

python bisection_method.py
```Follow the prompts and input your mathematical function```


Acknowledgments
Special thanks to the developers of the Bisection Method for providing a robust technique for root finding in numerical analysis. Further enhancements and contributions to this code are welcome.
